PostgreSQL database allows us a whole of bunch of pretty stuff from programming. Look down below.
- Functions
- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- Variable declaration
- Flow control
- Error handling
- Dynamic SQL 
- 
These features need database engineer for better interaction with database and improve performance and understand. 
Before we get started lets jump into PL/pgSQL. 

PLpgSQL is procedure language extension for PostgreSQL that allows you to write stored procedures, functions, triggers, etc using a syntax similar to that of Oracle's PL/SQL language. 
PL/pgSQL stands for (Procedural Language/PostgreSQL) and it provides a powerful and flexible environment for implementing complex logic and data processing within the PostgreSQL database.

Here are some key features and characteristics of PL/pgSQL:
1. **Syntax**: PL/pgSQL syntax is similar to that of other procedural languages like PL/SQL, making it familiar to developers who have experience with those languages. It includes constructs for declaring variables, control flow (IF-ELSE, CASE, LOOP), exception handling, and dynamic SQL.
2. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: PL/pgSQL allows you to define stored procedures and user-defined functions that can encapsulate business logic, data manipulation, and other operations within the database. These procedures and functions can be invoked from SQL queries or other procedural code.
3. **Triggers**: PL/pgSQL can be used to define trigger functions, which are automatically executed in response to specified database events (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Trigger functions written in PL/pgSQL can access and modify the data being processed and perform additional actions based on the event.
4. **Variable Declaration and Manipulation**: PL/pgSQL supports declaring variables of various data types and manipulating them within procedural code blocks. Variables can store intermediate results, inputs, parameters, or other values needed for computation.
5. **Flow Control**: PL/pgSQL provides constructs for controlling the flow of execution within procedural code including conditional statement (IF-ELSE), loops (FOR, WHILE), and exception handling (BEGIN-EXCEPTION-END). This allows us to implement complex logic and handle errors gracefully.
6. **Dynamic SQL**: PL/pgSQL allows you to construct and execute dynamic SQL statements at runtime, using variables and expressions. The flexibility enables you to build dynamic queries and perform tasks that require conditional or behavior.
7. **Integration with SQL**: PL/pgSQL seamlessly integrates with standard SQL, allowing you to mix SQL statements with procedural code within the same block. This makes it easy to leverage the power of SQL for data manipulation while using procedural constructs for control flow and logic. 

Overall, PL/pgSQL provides a robust and feature-rich environment for developing complex database applications and implementing custom business logic within PostgreSQL. Its familiarity, flexibility, and integration with  PostgreSQL make it a popular choice for building scalable and maintainable database solutions.
